# Jfadi-TrafficLightsProject

This project is a traffic light controller for a 4-corner intersection of two equally busy one-way streets using the EK-TM4C123GXL microcontroller.
There are two one-way streets are labeled South (cars travel South) and West (cars travel West). There are three inputs to the EK-TM4C123GXL, detecting cars:
• South sensor: traveling south going straight,
• Rt Turn sensor: traveling south making a right turn to the west direction, and
• West sensor: traveling west.
